# Sandbox Mono-Repository

Welcome to the Sandbox Mono-Repository! This repository serves as a dynamic playground for side projects related to work, testing, and implementations of various ideas and "random stuff". It's a space for exploration, innovation, and experimentation.

## Current Projects

### reactRouterGenerator

The `reactRouterGenerator` is a tool designed to streamline the creation of routes and pages for React projects. Leveraging React Router v6.4 and above, it simplifies the development process by generating basic route and page structures, saving time and effort. It's intuitive, ensuring compatibility and easing the development workflow with interactive prompts and automated folder creation.
